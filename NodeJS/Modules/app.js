//! Modules :--> It is a logical piece of code which can be used anywhere. It helps us to write clean and manageable code
//? it helps us to break-down complex problems into smaller pieces

//? using modules we can organize the code and also could solve the error more easily.

//? it helps us to avoid DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) concept/principle

//? in nodejs, each and every file is treated as a module

//* ==> import (un-packing) and export (packing)
//* ==> we have two standard formats
    //? ==> CommonJS (CJS) --> require() and module.exports, exports (nodeJS uses CommonJS modules by default)
    //? ==> ES6 Modules (ESM) --> import and export
